{\bf FORMAT FOR REPORTS}
\end{center}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The report should supply enough detail to make clear to someone like yourself what the purpose and methods are, how they were achieved, and what the results are, with diagrams as required. 

\item The data should be displayed (in graphs and tables for instance) in enough detail to allow confirmation of your conclusions.

\item The fundamental empirical basis of scientific fact is a number PLUS associated error. Without the error (usually quoted as a standard deviation or error on the mean, with the hidden -- and sometimes unwarranted -- assumption that the measurement error is normally distributed) it is impossible to assess the odds that the hypothesis that you are advancing is true. {\sl It is very important in these projects that you analyse the measurement (and any other) errors properly.}

\item The length is arbitrary, but as a guide, the {\sl Astronomical Exercises} can be reported in {\bf five to six pages}, perhaps with detailed lists of data as an appendix. The {\sl Spectroscopy} report might occupy {\bf ten to fifteen pages}, including graphs and diagrams, perhaps with a numerical appendix as for the {\sl AE} report.

\item Relevant references, acknowledgements, and attributions should be listed at the end.

\item The report should be produced by word processing, and be a neat and professional document, sensibly bound (perform the following thought experiments: (1) if your report were dropped from a height of two metres onto a hard floor, would it disintegrate? (2) you are the assessor: do you need a tin-opener to start reading this report? Both answers better be {\sl no}).

\item If working in tandem, note the name of your lab partner on the front of the book.

\item {\bf Deadlines} are three term weeks after the end of the relevant slot.

\end{enumerate}

{\bf ACCESS TO LABORATORIES AND CLASS LIBRARY}
\vspace*{0.3cm}

\noindent
For reasons of Health and Safety, and for security it will not be possible for you to remain in the laboratories after 5:00pm. The Library is available as study space. Arrangements to borrow books may be made with the librarian (Karen Moran, karen.moran@stfc.ac.uk; Rm. R11), who will also provide information about the library's collection and its borrowing. If you choose to remain in the Observatory after 5:00pm (to work in the Library, for example) you {\bf MUST} sign the out-of-hours attendance sheet at the gate-lodge.

%Undergraduate students may {\bf NOT} remain in
%the Observatory after 9:30pm unless accompanied by a staff member or
%supervisor.

{\begin{center}\bf SAFETY ISSUES \& CARE OF EQUIPMENT\end{center}}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Ensure equipment is properly connected to mains electricity, from final item ({\sl e.g.} lamp) to wall socket, before switching on. Switch off before changing connections. At the end of each work period, ensure that power is switched off at the wall.

\item In particular, do not use the spectral lamp power supply without a lamp installed, as very high voltages are generated.

\item Do not handle the spectral lamps directly, as they may be very hot; and your hands leave deposits that may etch the glass and destroy the lamp.

\item Do not touch optical surfaces. In particular, NEVER touch the face of a grating.

\item Always close down the laptop computers in an orderly fashion.

\item TLC with everything.
\end{enumerate}

{\large\bf Spectroscopy lab equipment}

An important part of this module of the laboratory course is to finish where you started, at least as far as equipment is concerned. At the start of the module, you should have your own bench with a complete inventory of equipment, listed below. At the finish, it should be neatly returned to this state, with all mains switches off and mains plugs removed from sockets, and {\sl checked with a demonstrator before departure}.

{\bf 1. ADJUSTMENT OF PRISM SPECTROMETER}

{\bf Levelling the Spectrometer}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{ap3labspec0.ps}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Check that you know how a prism spectrometer works.

\item Set the collimator parallel to the front of the bench\,(where you can lock it to the bench). Level the collimator with a spirit level. Make sure it is at the same height as the opening in the prism table cover\,(otherwise it won't fit!).

\item Fully open the slit and use a lens to focus a white light source on the slit. Set the telescope 180$^\circ$ from the collimator and adjust its height to receive beam from collimator. Level the telescope\footnote{\label{levelling} The bench itself may not be levelled. You want the set up to be parallel to your bench.} with the spirit level. Reduce the brightness of the beam and shorten the slit before looking through the eyepiece in the plate at the back of the telescope. Adjust the level using the screw on the saddle at the back of the telescope until the image of the slit is centred on the exit slot. Check that the collars on the saddle stems are set and locked with Allen screws.

\item Adjust and level the prism table, as follows. Place the prism on table. Replace the white light with a helium lamp. Take great care with the transformer, which develops a high open-circuit voltage: make sure that the lamp is inserted before you switch on the transformer. Find the minimum deviation~(See Appendix B) of the prism and bring the telescope round to this position. Shorten the slit and re-level the telescope\footnotemark[\ref{levelling}] with the fine screw\,(the bench may not be perfectly levelled). Check the levelling of the prism table\footnotemark[\ref{levelling}] by making sure that the spectrum remains at the same height when the prism is {\sl rotated through the spectrum on both sides of minimum deviation}. Small adjustments to the prism table levelling screws may be needed to make this perfect. For levelling, the shorter the slit, the more critically you can make this adjustment. The crosshair provides a good horizon. 

\item If the spectral lines are not vertical\,(i.e., not at right angles to dispersion), check the slit head, which is slightly rotatable\,(black knobs to the sides of the slit mount at the end of the collimator tube). Make the slit long for this adjustment.

\item Focus the collimator and telescope if necessary~(see Appendix B).

\item Make sure that you understand why there is a minimum deviation, and check that the angle of minimum deviation $D_{min}$, which occurs when light travels through the prism parallel to its base, is given in terms of prism angle $A$ and refractive index $n$ by \[  \sin \left( \frac{A+D_{min}}{2} \right) = n \sin \left( \frac{A}{2} \right)   \] {\bf Calculate} the refractive index $n$ for your prism and {\bf estimate the error in $n$}. {\sl Repeat the process for at least five emission lines to measure how the refractive index varies as a function of wavelength}. You should include a graph of refractive index versus wavelength in your report.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{ap3labspec1.ps}
\end{center}

\newpage

{\bf 2. ADJUSTMENT OF GRATING SPECTROMETER}

{\bf Levelling the spectrometer}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Replace the {\sl prism-and-its-table} by the grating. Be very careful NEVER to touch the face of the grating\footnote{If you have, don't try to clean it yourself, let your demonstrator know!}. The grating is to be used in the {\bf first order}, which is blazed at an angle of about 8$^\circ$.

\item Move the collimator and telescope to the front positions on the bench\,(marked out  by screw holes). Screw the collimator to the bench. Level the grating, for a start with the three screws on its table, using the spirit level.

\item Set up the white light plus lens and use a very wide slit to give plenty of light. Begin  adjustment by considering the grating as a mirror. Find the zeroth order\,(\ie direct reflection); place the grating at {\sl right angles} to the collimator and send the reflected light back on itself. Cover one half of the collimator lens with a piece of white paper: the reflected beam of the exposed half should coincide with the covered half. If it does not, tip the grating by using the front levelling foot.

\item Move the telescope out of the way~(if necessary) and rotate the grating to throw the light from it on the laboratory wall. The zeroth order and side spectra will be seen. By patient adjustment of level of grating the zeroth order will be made to move in a horizontal plane {\sl as the grating is rotated}. The side spectra may not, however, lie in the same plane as the zeroth order, because the grating rulings may not be vertical.

\item To adjust this~(make these changes very carefully, very little at a time), the grating is rotatable in its cell by screws at the top\,(loosen one  screw; tighten the other). When the rulings are vertical the first orders are at the same height as the zeroth order\,(though this does not remain so at the higher orders). Return the telescope to its position and centre the zeroth order\,(vertically) at the eyepiece by re-adjusting the level of the telescope\,(the fine adjustment screw ought to be sufficient since the instrument was already levelled in the prism position). Make the slit very short and get the zeroth order on the horizontal cross-wire. Rotate the grating and make final adjustments to get the side spectra at the same vertical height as the zeroth order.

\item Change to the helium lamp. Check that the slit is vertical. Place the horizontal cross-wire along the direction of dispersion\,(unfortunately the cross-wires are not rotatable so you may have to  unscrew the eyepiece a little to achieve this). Now make the slit very long. Place a spectrum line at the cross-wire: it should coincide with the vertical wire. If not, rotate the slit head in the collimator until it is.

\item Clamp the grating table in such a way that {\sl the entire first order spectrum can be brought into view by using the screw on the grating table. (Choose the first order that you can see {\bf more} of the spectrum at one time.)}

\end{enumerate}

% Okay, this is new text for the USB cameras....


{\bf Setting up the 25mm CCD camera system}

\begin{center}
\centerline{\psfig{file=ap3labspec3.ps,width=10.0cm}}
\end{center}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Set the yellow line of helium in the middle of the telescope eyepiece. (Optional: Place the metal cover over the spectrum tube which will reduce reflection of the table and contaminating the experiments of your neighbouring groups. Place the Big Lid over the grating, with the collimator lens inserted into its hole. This may may reduce lights from other groups illuminating onto your grating mirror.)

\item Replace the telescope with the 25mm lens CCD camera as follows. Loosen the saddle bases, and slide the telescope along the optical bench rearward from the grating table. {\sl Take great care as the structure is very unbalanced}. Lock the saddles onto the bench again, and transfer the CCD camera to the front of the optical bench. Now transfer the telescope to the section of optical bench from where the CCD camera was taken, and screw it securely to the bench.

\item Check that the height of the CCD camera is correct, and that it is aligned with the optical bench. Move it as close to the grating as possible, and lock it onto the bench. (Ask the demonstrators for a piece black cloth to shield the light from other groups if needed. Sometimes the {\it unknown light source} could be the light from your lamp that did not go through the collimator but falls onto the grating mirror.)

\item Boot the laptop computer, and login with the passwd {\tt slabuser}. Once you are logged in, plug-in the CCD camera USB cable (a green light should light up on the back of the camera).

\item The CCD camera is controlled via the software called {\sc flycapture} which is installed on the laptop, ask your demonstrator to show you how the software works. It is important to ensure that the CCD camera is set-up to read-out {\bf 16-bit images} and that the exposure time is set to an appropriate value. If everything is set-up properly, on the laptop display you should be able to see continually updating images from the camera. 

\item By adjusting the (1) aperture and (2) the focus rings on the camera lens (and the width of the entrance slit on the collimator if necessary), find the settings required to produce a sharp image of the helium spectrum.

\item {\bf You should remember to comment in your report on the significance of the aperture/focus ring settings which produce the best image quality.}

%{\bf Focussing the CCD camera}

%1. In Windows, double-click on the {\tt SpecRed}\footnote{
%The SpecRed package was built with Borland C++ Builder by Matthew Horrobin, 
%with
%assistance from John Cooper (1999)} icon. Increase the 
%{\tt SpecRed} window to full screen and use the slide bar
%so that you can see the numbers. Click on {\tt Load New} and enter the
%name of the file you just saved (previous section).

%2. Click on {\tt Examine line} and use the cursor to select a line to check 
%the slit misalignment angle - this can be refined now.

%{\large\sl It will be noted that to cover the entire spectrum, two grating position
%settings will be needed. In the rest of the work, this should be borne in 
%mind when planning the experiments. Do the following for lines at different 
%wavelengths, to check the performance of the lens.}

%3. Select a range of focus settings that will give a set of images covering
%the best focus position (it is best to do this with the camera lens
%aperture fully open, but remember to close the aperture down again
%once focussing is complete). Take exposures and save these 
%(it might for example be sensible to call the file by the focus 
%setting `A1.2', etc, for grating rotation position A, focus 
%reading 1.2 and so on) to file.



%4. Double-click on the {\tt SpecRed} icon. Load each saved image in
%turn, by clicking on {\tt Load New}. For each, click on {\tt Start save}
%and type a filename(end with return) in which to save your data. 
%Click on {\tt Examine line} and use the cursor to click on the image of the line 
%chosen.
%This gives an estimate of the effective width -- area divided by height

{\bf 3. IDENTIFYING UNKNOWN ELEMENTS}

\noindent
The aim of this experiment is to identify the emission line spectra of a series of different gas discharge tubes by measuring the wavelengths of the observed emission lines and comparing them to accurate laboratory values.

\begin{enumerate}

\item The first stage of the process is to have a reference image of the spectrum of a known element, from which we can wavelength calibrate our spectra. Wavelength calibration means fitting a simple function which transforms between wavelength and measured x-pixel position on the camera image.

\item For this experiment you are going to use the helium spectrum as the your wavelength reference spectrum. Consequently, the first stage is to take a reference image of the helium spectrum which contains as many emission lines as possible. To do this, you should rotate the diffraction grating to place the bright yellow helium line in roughly the centre of the camera image (as shown above).

\item[***] {\bf If you have moved the grating mirror or the camera, you have to redo everything starting from the next line.}

\item Once you are happy with your helium spectrum (remember to check that it is not saturated) save a number of images of it. The image will be saved as a {\tt pgm} file {\bf(Important: the filenames should be less than 15 characters long and contain no spaces and special characters)}.

\item Now you are ready to change the helium tube for discharge tubes with `unknown' elements in them.

{\sl Note 1. SWITCH OFF the lamp power supply before changing lamps}\\
{\sl Note 2. DO NOT TOUCH the lamps (for your safety -- they're hot; for their safety -- you damage the glass). The {\bf demonstrators} will swap the lamps.}

\item When changing from the helium tube to a new element(s), {\sc do not adjust the position of the camera or the diffraction grating}. If these settings are changed the wavelength calibration image you have obtained of the helium spectrum will be useless and you have to start from *** again for a new set of helium images for wavelength calibration.

\item Take images of the spectra of as many different gas discharge tubes as time permit. Remember, to get good quality images of the spectra of different elements you may well need to adjust the entrance slit, camera aperture and camera exposure time settings. Your demonstrator will be able to show you how to adjust the exposure time settings if necessary. Before obtaining your final images of the spectrum of each element, make sure that you are not saturating the camera (ask your demonstrator if you are not sure about this). Once you are happy with your images of the various spectra, save them as {\tt pgm} files on the laptop.

\end{enumerate}

{\bf Remember that if some of the emission lines are faint, it is possible to to take several images and then add them together to boost the signal-to-noise ratio\,(100 images should be sufficient). Ask your demonstrator(s) to show you how this is done in IRAF later in the analysis stage.}

\newpage

{\bf 4. COLOUR FILTERS}

The aim is to produce a graph of transmission versus wavelength for {\sl at least three} colour filters. This is a task that is routinely done by astronomers when they set up new colour photometric systems, or design filters to image just one spectral emission line, or design blocking filters for spectrometers on telescopes.

\begin{enumerate}

\item It is easiest to start with the green filter. Set up the continuum light source (bulb), and insert the filter in front of the slit. Seek a position and exposure/intensity setting that shows (a) no saturation of the CCD for filtered or unfiltered light, (b) full wavelength coverage of the part of the spectrum transmitted by the filter\footnote{You can check if the image is saturating by clicking on the {\tt ``horizontal line cut''} icon and examining the count levels in the image rows}.

{\it If you have moved the grating or camera since doing the previous experiment, you need to take another helium image for wavelength calibration purposes. If you haven't changed the spectrograph set-up, then your previous wavelength calibration should still be valid.}

\item Without altering any other part of the set-up, make and save {\sl unsaturated} images of the continuum source with and without the green filter (use the same exposure time for each). {\bf Remember that if the signal-to-noise you obtain for the transmission curve is too low, it is possible to take several images and add them up to improve the quality.}

\item Also without altering any of the settings, make and save `dark' frames by covering the camera lens with the lens cap before taking another exposure of the same duration. The dark frame is a measurement of the instrument noise produced in the absence of any signal.

\end{enumerate}

\newpage
{\bf 5. WAVELENGTH CALIBRATION}

\noindent
Once you have all of the necessary images saved on the laptop you will need to copy them onto a USB memory stick and transfer them to your account on the blackford server, as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Log-in to one of the blackford thin clients.

\item Insert the memory stick into the USB port located on the side of the thin client you are logged into.

\item A USB icon should appear on the desktop, allowing you to then drag your files across to your home space (if in doubt, ask one of the demonstrators to help).\\
\end{enumerate}

The files that have been transferred onto the server are in the (.pgm) format - these need to be converted to (.fits).  A program for converting the files, along with instructions on its use, can be found at the following link: http://www.roe.ac.uk/$\sim$mlam/teaching.html

{\large {\bf Note: Saving plots for your report}}\\
For the purposes of writing your final report you may want to include plots of the various stages of the reduction process. In {\sc iraf} you can generate postscript copies of the plots generated by {\it splot, identify} etc by typing: 

{\tt :.snap eps}

in the appropriate window. This will produce a postscript `.eps' copy of the {\sc iraf} window in your directory which can be viewed with ghostview (gv) and then printed.

You are going to analyse the spectra using a set of software packages called {\sc iraf} (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility\footnote{http://iraf.noao.edu/}). If you have already completed the Computer Exercises then you should already be familiar with {\sc iraf}, and the process of wavelength calibration. If not, don't worry, full instructions are provided here as well.

In your home directory you will find a directory called {\tt iraf}. Change into the {\tt iraf} directory (i.e. {\tt cd iraf}) and then type:

{\tt \verb,xgterm -sb &,}

\noindent
and from within the new terminal which appears, type: {\tt cl}

\noindent
This will start {\sc iraf} which should then display a list of available
packages. The list of packages that these exercises will use are listed in the Appendix A. These should be typed into the {\it login.cl} file so that you can access them without manually loading them in each time you access {\sc iraf} - the demonstrator should show you how to do this.

Now type {\tt cd ..} to move up a directory, back to where
your data are located \footnote{to exit {\sc iraf} at any time simply type {\tt logout}}. To display the various spectra you are going to use a software package called {\sc gaia}. For example, if your Helium calibration spectrum is
called {\tt heliumspectrum.fits}, if you type:

{\tt gaia heliumspectrum.fits \&}

in an xterm (not the {\sc iraf} window), your helium spectrum should appear in {\sc gaia}. For images taken with the CCD camera, the 
dispersion direction of the spectra is horizontal, with blue
wavelengths to the right and red wavelengths to the left. The basic
operation of {\sc gaia} is all ``point and
click'' and is fairly intuitive (online help is available by
clicking on the {\sc help} tab in the top right corner of the {\sc
gaia} window). You should spend some time familiarizing yourself with
how {\sc gaia} operates, learning how to zoom in and out, change the
auto-cut levels etc. If you are having difficulties, ask your lab
demonstrator to show you how the basic features work.

At this stage it is necessary to convert the two-dimensional Helium
image into a one dimensional spectrum. First, work out how many pixels
wide your two-dimensional Helium spectrum is (should be 1280 pixels). Next, work out what
the middle y-pixel value of the Helium spectrum is. As an example, if
the middle y-pixel value is 480 (and the spectrum is 1280 pixels wide) you would then type:

{\tt imcopy heliumspectrum.fits[1:1280,480:480] helium\verb,_,trim.fits}

which will produce a new, one dimensional spectrum running from x=1
to x=1280, but only one pixel in height. This is a spectrum of flux versus
x-pixel value which is suitable for further analysis. You can take a
first look at your one-dimensional spectrum using the {\sc iraf} task 
{\it splot} (spectra-plot). At the command prompt type:

{\tt splot helium\verb,_trim,.fits}

If {\it splot} asks you for a dispersion direction, type {\tt 1
  <return>}. As well as simply displaying spectra, the {\it splot} task allows you
to perform many basic analysis tasks (ask the demonstrator to show you
how it works).  Note that if you need to close {\it splot} for any reason,
it is imperative that you press ``q'' within the window first. The command
line prompt should then reappear and it is safe to close the {\it splot} window - 
if you do not do this, {\sc iraf} will crash and you will have to start over.

The next stage in the process is to perform the wavelength
calibration. At present, the one-dimensional Helium spectrum is 
simply flux versus x-pixel number, and we need to convert this into a 
one-dimensional spectrum of flux versus wavelength. The wavelength
calibration is performed using the {\sc iraf} task {\it identify}. 
At the command prompt, type:

{\tt identify helium\verb,_trim.fits,}

Which should open a new window displaying the one-dimensional Helium
spectrum. In order to make the identification of the arc lines easier, it
may be worthwhile extending the new window horizontally (ask the
demonstrator how to do this).

To identify the lines, click on the {\it identify} window to activate
it, place the cursor over the arc line of interest and press the ``m''
key to mark the line. At this point you will be asked to enter the
wavelength of the arc line. Repeat this process
until you have identified the $\simeq 9$ Helium lines which should be
visible in your spectrum. 

\noindent
Once you have
identified the lines you can press ``f'' to fit the dispersion
solution. The {\it identify} window will update to show you the fit,
at which point you can delete outlier points with the ``d'' key and
re-fit the solution by pressing ``f'' once again. {\bf Once you are happy
with the quality of the fit (all points within $\simeq1$\AA\,) you
should first note down the r.m.s of your wavelength solution (displayed in
{\tt xterm window}) because this is the typical uncertainty in the 
transformation between pixel coordinates and wavelength, which you will require later.}
Next you should press ``q'' twice to exit {\it identify}, and then
confirm (in the {\tt iraf} window) that you want to write the dispersion solution to the database. 

To let {\sc iraf} know that you want to associate this dispersion
solution with your one-dimensional spectrum, the {\sc iraf} package {\it hedit} (header edit) can be used. To add
the keyword ``REFSPEC1'', type:

{\tt hedit helium\verb,_trim.fits, fields=REFSPEC1 value=helium\verb,_trim.fits, add=yes}

And finally, to apply the wavelength calibration to your spectrum, type:

{\tt dispcor helium\verb,_trim.fits helium_trim_wave.fits,}

The task {\it dispcor} reads the keyword you have just added, pointing to the solution for {\tt \verb,helium_trim.fits,}, and applies this to the image.
You can now check that your wavelength solution is sensible by
displaying your wavelength calibrated Helium spectrum using {\tt splot}:

{\tt splot \verb,helium_trim_wave.fits,}

and by measuring the wavelengths of the emission lines using the
cursor and by pressing the space bar.

{\bf 5a. Identifying the unknown elements}

\noindent
To do this you should first process each of your different spectral images into
one-dimesional spectra as outlined above. Following that you can apply
your wavelength calibration using {\tt hedit} and {\tt dispcor}, again
as outlined above. Once you have produced wavelength calibrated
spectra for each element, you can measure the wavelengths of any
emission lines and compare them with standard laboratory values\footnote{

Note that you need to estimate the errors in your result to assess the wavelength matches
that you find. You can present the results in your laboratory report
in either a tabular or graphical format (see GnuPlot tutorial in
Appendix A for information on producing simple graphs).

\newpage

{\bf 5b. Calibrating colour filters}

\begin{enumerate}

\item After transferring your images to blackford, you should first subtract the dark frame from the filtered and unfiltered images using the {\tt imarith} task in {\sc iraf}:

   For example: {\tt \verb,imarith cont_spectrum.fits - dark_spectrum.fits cont_dark.fits,}

\item After dark subtraction you should produce one-dimensional, wavelength calibrated, spectra of the filtered and unfiltered images following the procedure from the previous experiment.

\item Finally, by dividing the two spectra (i.e. filtered/unfiltered using {\sc imarith}) you can produce a curve of the filter transmission with wavelength. You should be able to display this transmission curve using {\sc splot} and include the plot in your final report (see Appendix A).

\item Once you have successfully produced the transmission curve for the green filter, the final task is to produce identical curves for the orange/yellow and blue filters. The transmission curves for all three filters should be included in your final report. In the report you should comment on the different sources of uncertainty in your derivation of the filter curves, and how these could in principle be reduced.

\end{enumerate}

{\it For the yellow and blue filters you may need to adjust the exposure times to obtain images of the filtered spectrum with sufficient signal to analyse. In which case you will need to remember to take separate dark frames of the appropriate exposure time. Moreover, when you divide the filtered by the unfiltered spectrum to produce the transmission curve, you must first correct for any difference in exposure time (using {\tt imarith})}.

{\large{\bf 4. Gnuplot}}
\end{center}
This is designed to be a very brief tutorial on using the plotting
package Gnuplot. More information can be found at: {\tt
http://www.gnuplot.info/}, and a more detailed tutorial can be found
at: {\tt http://www.duke.edu/\textasciitilde hpgavin/gnuplot.html}.

Start Gnuplot by simply typing:

{\tt gnuplot -mono (return)}

on the command line. In your home directory I have included a file
called {\tt toydata.dat} to illustrate how the basic features of
Gnuplot work. This file contains three columns: x, y \& y error. 
To simply plot x versus y, type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot "toydata.dat"}

Gnuplot should produce a plot of x versus y in a new window, and will
automatically choose appropriate ranges for the x-axis and y-axis. To
label the axes and to add a title type:

{\tt gnuplot> set xlabel "x"}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set ylabel "y"}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set title "toydata plot"}

If you now type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot "toydata.dat"}

The graph should be correctly labelled. To plot the data including the
errors on the y variable you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot "toydata.dat" with yerrorbars}

To fit a function to your data-set you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> f1(x)=a*x+b}

which defines a new linear function (gnuplot can fit much more
complicated functions if necessary). And then type:

{\tt gnuplot> fit f1(x) "toydata.dat" using 1:2 via a,b}

which tells Gnuplot to fit the function to columns 1 \& 2 of
"toydata.dat", determining the best-fitting values of parameters a
\& b. To then produce a combined plot of your data and the best-fitting
function you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot "toydata.dat" with yerrorbars, f1(x)}\\
\newpage
At the end of this process the graph in the Gnuplot window should look
something like Fig 1. If you wanted to save your graph as a postscript
file (suitable for printing) you could type:

{\tt gnuplot> set terminal postscript landscape}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set output "toydataplot.ps"}\\
{\tt gnuplot> plot "toydata.dat" with yerrorbars, f1(x)}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set terminal x11}

which should produce a postscript file called "toydataplot.ps". The
final command returns the default output to the normal Gnuplot
window. To exit Gnuplot type {\tt CNTR-D}.

%\end{center}

The diagram shows a ray passing though a prism with refractive index $n$ and prism angle $A$. The ray is deviated by angle $D$. From geometry it is clear that:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
(90 \degree - r_1) + A + (90\degree - r_2)=180\degree 
\Rightarrow A=r_1 + r_2
\end{equation}
\end{center}
and that the angle of deviation $D$ is given by:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
D=(i_1 - r_1) + (i_2 - r_2) = i_1 + i_2 - A
\end{equation}
\end{center}
The minimum deviation occurs when:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
{\Large
\frac{dD}{d i_1}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{d i_2}{d i_1}=-1
}
\end{equation}
\end{center}

A simple geometrical argument demonstrates that the minimum deviation must happen when $i_1 = i_2$ (i.e. when the light ray passes through the prism parallel to the base). If this were not the case, we could simply reverse the direction of the light path to prove that there are two distinct angles of minimum deviation, which is not true.

At minimum deviation ($i_1=i_2$) we can see from equation 2 that: $i_1=\frac{D_{min}+A}{2}$\\

And from Snell's law ($\sin i_1=n\sin r_1$), at minimum deviation ($r_1=r_2=A/2$) we have:
$\sin i_1=n\sin\frac{A}{2}$ which in turn means that:
\begin{equation}
{\Large
n\sin\frac{A}{2}=\sin\frac{D_{min}+A}{2}
}
\end{equation}
This equation allows us to calculate the refractive index of the prism.
\newpage
\begin{center}
{\large{\bf 2. Schuster's method}}
\end{center}
We have just demonstrated that $d i_2 = -d i_1$ at the minimum deviation. However, at an arbitrary angle of incidence, a small change in incidence angle $i_1$ gives rise to a change in emergence angle $i_2$ which can be written
\[   \mbox{\rm d}i_2 = - K\:\mbox{\rm d}i_1    \]
where $K$ can be calculated from Snell's law (e.g. $\sin i =n \sin r $) which, at each surface, gives
\[  \mbox{\rm d}i = n (\cos r/\cos i)\mbox{\rm d}r.   \]
Since $r_1 + r_2 = A$ (a constant) d$r_1$ = -d$r_2$ and hence
\[  K = \left(\frac{\cos r_2}{\cos i_2}\right) / 
    \left(\frac{\cos r_1}{\cos i_1}\right)       =
     \sqrt{\frac{1-\mu^2\sec^2 r_1}{1-\mu^2\sec^2 r_2}},  \]
To prove this result requires some algebra. You will need to use Snell's law, the identity $sin^2 \theta + cos^2\theta =1$ and make the substitution: $\mu^2 =  1 - 1/n^2$. Hence if $i_2<i_1$ then, since $r_2<r_1$ and $\sec r_2 <  \sec r_1$, it follows that $K<1$. This means that $|di_2|<|di_1|$. And conversely, if $i_2>i_1$ then $K>1$ and $|di_2|>|di_1|$.

\vspace*{3mm}

{\large Thus the result:  a small change in incidence angle $i_1$ makes a smaller change in emergence angle $i_2$ if the emergence angle is smaller than the incidence angle (and bigger if bigger).}\\

\vspace*{3mm}

\noindent
By applying this principle we can focus the spectrometer. The basic idea is that you find the minimum deviation of the prism (at which point $i_1=i_2$). You then move the prism away from minimum deviation, such that $i_2>i_1$ and re-acquire the emission line with the telescope (position 1). From the above argument, at this position a small change in $i_1$ will result in a larger change in $i_2$ - which means that any defocus in the telescope will be exaggerated (which is why it is best to focus the telescope in this position). In the second prism position where you can see the emission line $i_2<i_1$. This means that any defocus in the collimator will be exaggerated at this position (which is why we focus the collimator in this position).

%\vspace*{3mm}
%$\end{minipage}
%}

Applying the principle to the spectrometer we see the following.

When all the light rays incident on the prism are parallel then all are deviated by the same amount and emerge parallel, and so the focus position of the telescope remains the same whatever the deviation, and the image remains sharp  moving from one side of minimum deviation to the other. 

However, if the incident beam is convergent or divergent on the prism (set so that the emergent rays are  more nearly normal, \ie average incidence angle is greater than average emergence angle), then the range of angles of emergent rays is {\sl less\/}: they are more parallel as they leave the prism and enter the telescope. In this case, the telescope should be focussed as its focus position will be more nearly at the focal plane. Moving to the other prism position at which the line is visible, the collimator beam is the more parallel, so the collimator should be focussed in the beam which -- since it is more parallel than is the telescope beam -- will bring the focus position of the collimator even closer to its focal plane. Alternating positions and focussing the more parallel beam will converge to the situation in which each beam is parallel, and the system is focussed for that wavelength.

\item Set the prism at minimum deviation on one spectrum line, e.g., green (see Helium picture and tables).  Close the slit to fairly narrow width. Rotate the prism table away from minimum deviation, increasing angle of {\em incidence} on  prism; we'll call this prism position 1'. Then move the telescope to find the line.

\item Focus the telescope for a sharp line (first focus eyepiece (push/pull) on cross-wire, then  focus spectrum line on cross-wire).

\item Keep telescope fixed in the same position. Rotate prism table in the direction opposite to 1. above, thus {\em decreasing\/} angle of incidence on  prism, until the image of the same line again appears central in the eyepiece.  Focus the collimator.  To focus the collimator while viewing through the eyepiece get your lab partner to focus while you view through the slit. Now return the prism to its position 1. 

\item Repeat processes (2) and (3), and continue until no further improvement is possible.   Note collimator scale reading.

\item Repeat the process with other spectrum lines and draw up a table and graph relating collimator scale reading to wavelength. {\bf Estimate and explain the sources of the errors in the measurements, and explain any trends.}

\item Choose the collimator position which you think is the best average position for the  wavelength range you intend to use, and fix it permanently.

\noindent
Addition/Subtraction: If $f=a\pm b$, then $\sigma_f$ is given by:
\begin{center}
\Large {$\sigma^2_{f} = \sigma_a^2 + \sigma_b^2$}
\end{center}

\bigskip

Multiplication/Division: if $f=ab$ or $f=a/b$, then $\sigma_f$ is
given by:
\begin{center}
\Large{$\left(\frac{\sigma_f}{f}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sigma_a}{a}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sigma_b}{b}\right)^2$}
\end{center}

\bigskip

Raising to a power: If $f=a^c$, where $c$ is a constant, then
$\sigma_f$ is:
\begin{center}
\Large{$\frac{\sigma_f}{f}=c\left(\frac{\sigma_a}{a}\right)$}
\end{center}

\bigskip

Logarithms: If $f=\log_{e}(a)$ then $\sigma_f$ is given by:
\begin{center}
\Large{$\frac{\sigma_f}{f}=\frac{1}{a}$}
\end{center}
Remember that: $\log_{e}(a)=\log_{e}(10)\times \log_{10}(a)$

{\large{\bf 2. Calculation of magnitude errors}}
\end{center}

The definition of magnitude is:

\begin{equation}
m = -2.5\times log_{10} C
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $C$ is the object counts within the aperture. This can be re-written as:

\begin{equation}
m = -2.5/ln(10) \times ln C
\end{equation}

\noindent
which can be differentiated to give:

\begin{equation}
dm = -2.5/ln(10) \times (\delta C/C)
\end{equation}

\noindent
This is the equation that {\sc gaia} uses to calculate the magnitude
error ($dm$) in terms of the error on the object counts within the
aperture ($\delta C)$.

You should remember that the total counts within the aperture ($t$)
are a combination of the counts from the object ($C$) and the counts from the
sky ($s$):

\begin{equation}
t= C + s 
\end{equation}

where $s$ is the mean sky counts multiplied by the number of pixels
within the aperture. Therefore, the final error on the objects counts
is the sum in quadrature of the error on the total counts and the
error on the sky counts:

\begin{equation}
\delta C = \sqrt( \delta t^2 + \delta s^2 )
\end{equation}

Moreover, due to the fact that we are dealing with Poisson/counting
errors, we can also assume that:

\begin{equation}
\delta t = \sqrt(t)\,\, {\rm and}\,\, \delta s = \sqrt(s)
\end{equation}

which means that the error on the object counts ($\delta C$) is
simply:

\begin{equation}
\delta C = \sqrt(t+s)
\end{equation}

substituting this back into Eqn 7 then allows you to calculate the
magnitude error ($dm$).

\centerline{\psfig{file=ap3labasteroid.ps,width=15.0cm,angle=0}}

Over time $t$, the asteroid has moved by an angle $\theta$, so
\begin{align*}
D_{A} &= v_{A}t \\
D_{E} &= v_{E}t.
\end{align*}
Subtracting one by the other, we have
\begin{equation*}
D_{E}-D_{A}=(v_{E}-v_{A})t
\end{equation*}
By trigonometry, we also know that
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \frac{D_{E}-D_{A}}{a-1},
\end{equation*}
hence
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \frac{(v_{E}-v_{A})t}{a-1}
\end{equation*}
Assuming the Earth and the asteroid follow two concentric circular orbits, by equating the Gravitational force to the centripetal force for the Earth,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{GM_{\odot}M_{E}}{r_{E}^{2}} = \frac{M_{E}v_{E}^{2}}{r_{E}};
\end{equation*}
and for the asteroid,
\begin{equation*}
\frac{GM_{\odot}M_{A}}{r_{A}^{2}} = \frac{M_{A}v_{A}^{2}}{r_{A}}
\end{equation*}
Solving these two relations gives
\begin{equation*}
v_{A} = \frac{v_{E}}{\sqrt{r_{A}}} = \frac{v_{E}}{a}.
\end{equation*}
Hence,
\begin{align*}
\theta &= \frac{v_{E}(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}})t}{a-1} \\
\frac{\theta}{v_{E}t} &= \frac{1}{a-1} \frac{\sqrt{a}-1}{\sqrt{a}} \\
&= \frac{1}{(\sqrt{a}+1)(\sqrt{a}-1)} \frac{\sqrt{a}-1}{\sqrt{a}} \\
\sqrt{a} &= \frac{-1\pm \sqrt{1+\frac{4v_{E}t}{\theta}}}{2}.
\end{align*}
