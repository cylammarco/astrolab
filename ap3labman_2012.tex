{\bf FORMAT FOR REPORTS}
\end{center}

1. The report should supply enough detail to make clear to someone like
yourself what the purpose and methods are, how they were achieved, and
what the results are, with diagrams as required. 

2. The data
should be displayed (in graphs and tables for instance) in enough detail to
allow confirmation of your conclusions.

3. The fundamental empirical basis of scientific fact is a number PLUS
associated error. Without the error (usually quoted as a standard deviation
or error on the mean, with the hidden -- and sometimes unwarranted -- assumption that the measurement
error is normally distributed) it is impossible to assess the odds that the 
hypothesis that you are advancing is true. {\sl It is very important in these
projects that you analyse the measurement (and any other) errors properly.}

4. The length is arbitrary, but as a guide, the {\sl Astronomical Exercises} 
can be reported in five to six pages, perhaps with detailed lists of data as 
an appendix. The {\sl Spectroscopy} report might occupy ten to fifteen pages, 
including graphs and diagrams, perhaps with a numerical appendix as for the 
{\sl AE} report.

5. Relevant references, ackowledgements, and attributions should be listed
at the end.

6. The report should be produced by word processing, and be a neat and
professional document, sensibly bound (perform the following thought 
experiments: (1) if your report were dropped from a height of two metres onto a
hard floor, would it disintegrate? (2) you are the assessor: do you need a
tin-opener to start reading this report? Both answers better be {\sl no}).

7. If working in tandem, note the name of your lab partner on the front of 
the book.

8. {\bf Deadlines} are three term weeks after the end of the relevant slot.

{\begin{center}\bf SAFETY  ISSUES \& CARE OF EQUIPMENT\end{center}}

1. Ensure equipment is properly connected to mains electricity, from final 
item ({\sl e.g.} lamp) to wall socket, before switching on. Switch off
before changing connections. At the end of each work period, ensure that 
power is switched off at the wall.

2. In particular, do not use the spectral lamp power supply without a lamp 
installed, as very high voltages are generated.

3. Do not handle the spectral lamps directly, as they may be very hot; and your
hands leave deposits that may etch the glass and destroy the lamp.

4. Do not touch optical surfaces. In particular, NEVER touch the face of
a grating.

5. Always close down the laptop computers in an orderly fashion.

6. TLC with everything.

{\bf 1. ADJUSTMENT OF PRISM SPECTROMETER}

{\bf Levelling the Spectrometer}

\begin{center}
\includegraphics{ap3labspec0.ps}
\end{center}

0. Check that you know how a prism spectrometer works.

1. Set the collimator parallel to the front of the bench (where the drawers 
are!). Level the collimator with a spirit level. Make sure it is at the same
height as the  opening in the prism table cover (otherwise it won't fit!).

2. Open the slit wide and illuminate by a white light source (use a lens to
focus filament on slit).  Set telescope 180$^\circ$ from collimator and
adjust its height to receive beam from  collimator.  Level telescope
with spirit level.  Reduce the brightness of the beam  and shorten the
slit before looking through the eyepiece in the plate at
the back of the telescope.  Adjust the level using the screw on the saddle at the
back of the  telescope until the image of the slit is centred in the
exit slot. Check that the collars on the saddle stems are set and locked with 
Allen screws.

3. Adjust and level the prism table, as follows.  Place the prism on table.
Replace the white light with a helium or mercury lamp.
Take great care with the  transformer, which develops a high
open-circuit voltage: make sure that the lamp is  inserted before you
switch on the transformer.  Find the minimum deviation of the prism and bring the
telescope round to this position. Shorten the slit and re-level the
telescope with the fine screw (the bench may not be perfectly level).
Check the levelling of the prism table  by making sure that the
spectrum remains at the same height  when the prism is
rotated through the spectrum on both sides of minimum deviation.
Small  adjustments to the prism table levelling screws may be needed
to make this perfect.   For levelling, the shorter the slit, the more
critically you can make this adjustment.

4. If the spectrum lines are not vertical  (i.e., not at right angles
to dispersion), check  the slit head, which is slightly rotatable
(black knobs to the sides of the slit mount at the end of the collimator
tube).  Make the slit long for this adjustment.

\newpage
5. Make sure that you understand why there is a minimum deviation (see
theory on Page 5), and check that the angle of 
minimum deviation $D_{min}$, which occurs when light travels through the 
prism parallel to its base, is given in terms of 
prism angle $A$ and refractive index $n$ by 
\[  \sin \frac{A+D_{min}}{2} = n \sin \frac{A}{2}   \] {\bf Calculate the 
refractive index $n$ for your prism and estimate the error in n}. 
Repeat the process for a number of different emission lines to measure 
how the refractive index varies as a function of wavelength (you should include a graph of 
refractive index versus wavelength in your spectroscopy report).

{\large {\bf Focussing the collimator by Schuster's method}\footnote{
SCHUSTER, A., 1879, `An easy Method for Adjusting the Collimator of
a Spectroscope',  {\sl Phil. Mag.} {\bf 7}, 95} }

 1. Set the prism at minimum deviation on one spectrum line, e.g., green
(see Helium picture and tables).  Close the slit to fairly narrow width.
Rotate the prism table away from minimum deviation, increasing angle of
{\em incidence} on  prism; we'll call this prism position 1'. 
Then move the telescope to find the line.

2. Focus the telescope for a sharp line (first focus eyepiece (push/pull) on 
cross-wire, then  focus spectrum line on cross-wire).

3. Keep telescope fixed in the same position. Rotate prism table in the 
direction opposite to 1. above, thus {\em decreasing\/} angle
of incidence on  prism, until the image of the same line again appears
central in the eyepiece.  Focus the
collimator.  To focus the collimator while viewing through the
eyepiece get your lab partner to focus while you view through
the slit. Now return the prism to its position 1. 

4. Repeat processes (2) and (3), and continue until no further
improvement is possible.   Note collimator scale reading.

5. Repeat the process with other spectrum lines and draw up a table
and graph relating collimator scale reading to wavelength. {\bf Estimate and 
explain the sources of the errors in the measurements, and explain any trends.}

6. Choose the collimator position which you think is the best average
position for the  wavelength range you intend to use, and fix it
permanently.

{\large {\bf Minimum deviation and the principle of Schuster's method}}

\centerline{\psfig{file=ap3labspec2.ps,width=8.0cm,angle=0}}
%\end{center}

The diagram shows a ray passing though a prism with refractive index $n$
and prism angle $A$. The ray is deviated by angle $D$. From geometry
it is clear that:\\
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
(90 \degree - r_1) + A + (90\degree - r_2)=180\degree 
\Rightarrow A=r_1 + r_2
\end{equation}
\end{center}
and that the angle of deviation $D$ is given by:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
D=(i_1 - r_1) + (i_2 - r_2) = i_1 + i_2 - A
\end{equation}
\end{center}
The minimum deviation occurs when:
\begin{center}
\begin{equation}
{\Large
\frac{dD}{d i_1}=0 \Rightarrow \frac{d i_2}{d i_1}=-1
}
\end{equation}
\end{center}

A simple geometrical argument demonstrates that the minimum deviation
must happen when $i_1 = i_2$ (i.e. when the light ray passes
through the prism parallel to the base). If this were not the case, we
could simply reverse the direction of the light path to prove that
there are two distinct angles of minimum deviation, which is not true.

At minimum deviation ($i_1=i_2$) we can see from equation 2 that:
$i_1=\frac{D_{min}+A}{2}$\\

And from Snell's law ($\sin i_1=n\sin r_1$), at minimum deviation
($r_1=r_2=A/2$) we have:
$\sin i_1=n\sin\frac{A}{2}$
which in turn means that:
\begin{equation}
{\Large
n\sin\frac{A}{2}=\sin\frac{D_{min}+A}{2}
}
\end{equation}
This equation allows us to calculate the refractive index of the
prism.
\newpage
{\large{\bf Schuster's method}}\\
We have just demonstrated that $d i_2 = -d i_1$ at the minimum
deviation. However, at an arbitrary angle of incidence, a small change
in incidence angle $i_1$ gives rise to a change in 
emergence angle $i_2$ which can be written
\[   \mbox{\rm d}i_2 = - K\:\mbox{\rm d}i_1    \]
where $K$ can be calculated from Snell's law
(e.g. $\sin i =n \sin r $) which, at each surface, gives
\[  \mbox{\rm d}i = n (\cos r/\cos i)\mbox{\rm d}r.   \]
Since $r_1 + r_2 = A$ (a constant) d$r_1$ = -d$r_2$ and hence
\[  K = \left(\frac{\cos r_2}{\cos i_2}\right) / 
    \left(\frac{\cos r_1}{\cos i_1}\right)       =
     \sqrt{\frac{1-\mu^2\sec^2 r_1}{1-\mu^2\sec^2 r_2}},  \]

To prove this result requires some algebra. You will need to use
Snell's law, the identity $sin^2 \theta + cos^2\theta =1$ and make the
substitution: $\mu^2 =  1 - 1/n^2$.

Hence if $i_2<i_1$ then, since $r_2<r_1$ and $\sec r_2 <  \sec r_1$, it 
follows that $K<1$. This means that $|di_2|<|di_1|$. And conversely, if
$i_2>i_1$ then $K>1$ and $|di_2|>|di_1|$.


\vspace*{3mm}

{\large Thus the result:  a small change in incidence angle $i_1$ makes a 
smaller change in emergence angle $i_2$ if the emergence angle is 
smaller than the incidence angle (and bigger if bigger).}\\

\medskip

\noindent
By applying this principle we can focus the spectrometer. The basic
idea is that you find the minimum
deviation of the prism (at which point $i_1=i_2$). You then move the
prism away from minimum deviation, such that $i_2>i_1$ and re-acquire
the emission line with the telescope (position 1). From the above
argument, at this position a small change in $i_1$ will result in a larger
change in $i_2$ - which means that any defocus in the telescope will
be exaggerated (which is why it is best to focus the
telescope in this position). In the second prism position where you
can see the emission line $i_2<i_1$. This means that any defocus in
the collimator will be exaggerated at this position (which is why we
focus the collimator in this position).


%\vspace*{3mm}
%$\end{minipage}
%}

\newpage

Applying the principle to
the spectrometer we see the following.

When all the light rays incident on the prism are parallel 
then all are deviated by the same amount and emerge parallel, and
so the focus position of the telescope remains the same whatever the
deviation, and the image remains sharp  moving from one side of
minimum deviation to the other. 

However, if the incident beam is convergent or divergent on the prism 
(set so that the emergent rays are  more nearly normal, \ie 
average incidence angle is greater than average emergence angle), then
the range of angles of emergent rays is {\sl less\/}: they are 
 more parallel as they leave the prism and enter the telescope.
In this case, the telescope should be focussed as its focus position will be
more nearly at the focal plane. Moving to the other prism 
position at
which the line is visible, the collimator beam is the more parallel,
so the collimator should be focussed in the beam which -- since it is more 
parallel than is the telescope beam -- will bring the focus position of the 
collimator even closer to its focal plane. Alternating positions and 
focussing the 
more parallel beam will converge to the situation in which each beam is 
parallel, and the system is focussed for that wavelength.

{\bf 2. ADJUSTMENT OF GRATING SPECTROMETER}

{\bf Levelling the spectrometer}

1. Replace the prism and its table by the grating.  Be very careful
NEVER to touch the  face of the grating.  The grating is to be used
in the first order, which is blazed at  an angle of about 8$^\circ$
(particulars of the grating are supplied with each in the red box  at
the back of one of the bench drawers.  Do not lose this sheet; return
it to the box).

2. Move the collimator and telescope to the front positions on the
bench (marked out  by screw holes).  Screw the collimator to the
bench.  Level the grating, for a start  with the three screws on its
table, using the spirit level.

3. Set up the white light plus lens and use a very wide slit to give
plenty of light.  Begin  adjustment by considering the grating as a
mirror.  Find the zero order (= direct  reflection); place the grating
at right angles to the collimator and send the reflected  light back
on itself.  Cover one half of the collimator lens with a piece of
white  paper: the reflected beam of the exposed half should coincide
with the covered half.   If it does not, tip the grating by using the
front levelling foot.

4. Move the telescope out of the way and rotate the grating to throw
the light from it  on the laboratory wall.  The zero order and side
spectra will be seen.  By patient  adjustment of level of grating the
zero order will be made to move in a horizontal  plane as the grating
is rotated.  The grating (considered as a mirror) is now
perpendicular to the beam from the collimator.  The side spectra may
not, however,  lie in the same plane as the zero order, because the
grating rulings may not be  vertical.

5. To adjust this, the grating is rotatable in its cell by screws at
the top (loosen one  screw; tighten the other).  Make these changes
very carefully, very little at a time.   When the rulings are vertical
the side spectra are at the same height as the zero  order (though
this does not remain so at the higher orders).  Return the telescope
to  its position and get the zero order central (vertically) in the
eyepiece by re-adjusting  the level of the telescope (the fine
adjustment screw ought to be sufficient since the  instrument was
already levelled in the prism position).  Make the slit very short and
get the zero order on the horizontal cross-wire.  Rotate the grating
and make final  adjustments to get the side spectra at the same
vertical height as the zero order.   (Concentrate on the first orders
and especially the blazed one, which has red on the  right and violet
on the left, as viewed).

6. Change to the Helium lamp. Check that the slit is vertical.  
Place the horizontal cross-wire
along the direction of  dispersion (unfortunately the cross-wires are
not rotatable so you may have to  unscrew the eyepiece a little to
achieve this).  Now make the slit very long.  Place a  spectrum line
at the cross-wire: it should coincide with the vertical wire.  If not,
rotate the slit head in the collimator until it is.

7. Clamp the grating table in such a way that the entire first order
spectrum can be  brought into view by using the screw on the grating
table.

% Okay, this is new text for the USB cameras....


{\bf Setting up the CCD 25mm camera system}

\begin{center}
\scalebox{0.9}{\includegraphics{ap3labspec3.ps}}
\end{center}

1. Set the yellow line of Helium centrally in the telescope eyepiece. 
Place the metal cover over the
grating, with the collimator lens inserted into its hole.

2. Replace the telescope with the CCD camera and 25mm lens as follows. 
Loosen the saddle bases, and slide the telescope along the optical bench rearward from the 
grating table. {\sl Take great care as the structure is very unbalanced\/}. Lock the saddles
onto the bench again, and transfer the CCD camera to the front of the
optical bench. Now transfer the telescope to the section of
optical bench from where the CCD camera was taken, and screw it securely
to the bench.

3. Check that the height of the CCD camera is correct, and that it is aligned 
with the optical bench. Move it as far toward the grating as possible, and
lock it onto the bench.

4. Boot the laptop computer, and login with the passwd {\tt lab}. Once
   you are logged in, plug-in the CCD camera USB cable (a green light
   should light up on the back of the camera). 

%On the laptop,
%   double-click on the {\tt uEyeDemo} icon to start the camera
%   software. The screen should now look something like this:
%\begin{center}
%\scalebox{0.8}{\includegraphics{screenshot.ps}}
%\end{center}
%\newpage

5. The CCD camera is controlled via software called {\sc flycapture} which is installed on the 
laptop, ask your demonstrator to show you how the software works. It is important to ensure that the CCD camera is set-up to read-out 16-bit images and that the exposure time is set to an appropriate value.  If everything is set-up properly, on the laptop display you should be able to see

6. By adjusting the aperture and focus rings on the camera lens (and
   the width of the entrance slit on the collimator), find the
   settings required to produce a sharp image of the Helium
   spectrum. Ideally this should look something like this:

7. {\bf You should remember to comment in your report on the significance
   of the aperture/focus ring settings which produce the best image quality.}

%{\bf Focussing the CCD camera}

%1. In Windows, double-click on the {\tt SpecRed}\footnote{
%The SpecRed package was built with Borland C++ Builder by Matthew Horrobin, 
%with
%assistance from John Cooper (1999)} icon. Increase the 
%{\tt SpecRed} window to full screen and use the slide bar
%so that you can see the numbers. Click on {\tt Load New} and enter the
%name of the file you just saved (previous section).

%2. Click on {\tt Examine line} and use the cursor to select a line to check 
%the slit misalignment angle - this can be refined now.

%{\large\sl It will be noted that to cover the entire spectrum, two grating position
%settings will be needed. In the rest of the work, this should be borne in 
%mind when planning the experiments. Do the following for lines at different 
%wavelengths, to check the performance of the lens.}

%3. Select a range of focus settings that will give a set of images covering
%the best focus position (it is best to do this with the camera lens
%aperture fully open, but remember to close the aperture down again
%once focussing is complete). Take exposures and save these 
%(it might for example be sensible to call the file by the focus 
%setting `A1.2', etc, for grating rotation position A, focus 
%reading 1.2 and so on) to file.



%4. Double-click on the {\tt SpecRed} icon. Load each saved image in
%turn, by clicking on {\tt Load New}. For each, click on {\tt Start save}
%and type a filename(end with return) in which to save your data. 
%Click on {\tt Examine line} and use the cursor to click on the image of the line 
%chosen.
%This gives an estimate of the effective width -- area divided by height
% -- of the line.

%5. All of these data are saved to the file you named. You can examine its
%contents using the Windows$^{\mbox{\copyright}}$ program {\tt Notepad}. 
%Double-click on the {\tt Notepad} icon, select {\tt File, Open}. Select the
%filename you created in 4. above (in {\tt C:/ccd}) to see the values printed.
%Now you will have for
%each line you measure a set of (camera focus setting, effective width). 
%These data
%sets are then processed on the UNIX system using the program
%{\tt lsqmin}, which requests the name of a UNIX file which you have edited
%to contain the values from the {\tt Notepad} file. The program fits,
%by the method of least squares, these data to estimate the camera setting 
%for the smallest effective width for each wavelength.

%6. When this is complete, set the camera focus to best focus. {\sl Justify the 
%accuracy obtained, and relate the numbers to the physical dimensions of the 
%system.}

{\bf 3. IDENTIFYING UNKNOWN ELEMENTS}

\noindent
The aim of this experiment is to identify the emission line spectra of
a series of different gas discharge tubes by measuring the wavelengths of the
observed emission lines and comparing them to accurate laboratory values.

1. The first stage of the process is to have a reference image of the
   spectrum of a known element, from which we can wavelength calibrate
   our spectra. Wavelength calibration means fitting a simple
   function which transforms between wavelength and measured x-pixel 
   position on the camera image.

2. For this experiment you are going to use the Helium spectrum as the
   your wavelength reference spectrum. Consequently, the first stage
   is to take a reference image of the Helium spectrum which contains
   as many emission lines as possible. To do this, you should rotate
   the diffraction grating to place the bright yellow Helium line in
   the centre of the camera image (as shown above).

3. Once you are happy with your Helium spectrum (remember to check
   that it's not saturated) save an image of it. Save the image as a (.pgm)
   file {\bf(Important: the filename should be less than 15 characters long
   and contain no spaces)}.

4. Now you are ready to change the Helium tube for a discharge tube
   with an ``unknown'' element in it.

{\sl Note 1. SWITCH OFF the lamp power supply before changing lamps}\\
{\sl Note 2. DO NOT TOUCH the lamps (for your safety -- they're hot; 
for their safety -- you damage the glass). The demonstrator will swap 
lamps.}

\newpage

5. When changing from the Helium tube to a new element, do not adjust
   the position of the camera or the diffraction grating. {\bf If these
   settings are changed the wavelength calibration image you have
   obtained of the Helium spectrum will be useless.}


6. Take images of the spectra of two or three different gas discharge
   tubes. Remember, to get good quality images of the spectra of
   different elements you may well need to adjust the entrace slit,
   camera aperture and camera exposure time settings. Your
   demonstrator will be able to show you how to adjust the exposure
   time settings if necessary. Before obtaining your final images of
   the spectrum of each element, make sure that you are not saturating
   the camera (ask your demonstrator if you are not sure about
   this). Once you are happy with your images of the various spectra,
   save them as .pgm files on the laptop.

   {\bf Remember that if some of the emission lines are faint, it is possible to to take
several images and then add them together to boost the signal-to-noise
ratio. Ask your demonstrator to show you how this is done in IRAF.}



7. Once you have all of the necessary images saved on the laptop you will need to convert them
from .pgm format into .fits format to be able to analyse them. Use the software package {\sc ImageJ} which is installed on the laptop to convert between the two image formats (ask your demonstrator to show you how to do this). Once you have converted the images into .fits format, copy them onto a USB memory stick and transfer them to your account on the blackford server, as follows:


a) Log-in to one of the blackford thin clients.\\

\medskip

b) Insert the memory stick into the USB port located on the side of the thin
client you are logged into.\\

\medskip

c) A USB icon should appear on the desktop, allowing you to then drag your files across
to your home space (if in doubt, ask one of the demonstrators to help).\\

\medskip

{\large {\bf Note: Saving plots for your report}}\\
For the purposes of writing your final report you may want to include
plots of the various stages of the reduction process. For capturing
screenshots of any window the easiest thing is probably to use the
software package {\it xv}. In {\sc iraf} you can generate
postscript copies of the plots generated by {\it splot, identify} etc
by typing: 

{\tt :.snap eps}

in the appropriate window. This will produce a postscript ``.eps''
copy of the {\sc iraf} window in your directory which can be viewed
with ghostview (gv) and then printed.

\newpage


%\bigskip
{\bf 3b. Wavelength Calibration}

\noindent
You are going to analyse the spectra using a set of software packages 
called {\sc iraf} (Image Reduction and Analysis
Facility\footnote{http://iraf.noao.edu/}). If you have already
completed the Computer Exercises then you should already be familiar
with {\sc iraf}, and the process of wavelength calibration. If not,
don't worry, full instructions are provided here as well.

In your home directory you will find a directory called {\tt
  iraf}. Change into the {\tt iraf} directory (i.e. {\tt cd iraf}) and
  then type:

{\tt \verb,xgterm -sb &,}

\noindent
and from within the new terminal which appears, type: {\tt cl}

\noindent
This will start {\sc iraf} which should then display a list of available
packages. Now type {\tt cd ..} to move up a directory, back to where
your data are located \footnote{to exit {\sc iraf} at any time simply
  type {\tt logout}}. To display the various spectra you are going to use a software package
called {\sc gaia}. For example, if your Helium calibration spectrum is
called {\tt heliumspectrum.fits}, if you type:

{\tt gaia heliumspectrum.fits \&}

in an xterm (not the {\sc iraf} window), your Helium spectrum should appear in {\sc gaia}. For images taken with the CCD camera, the 
dispersion direction of the spectra is horizontal, with blue
wavelengths to the right and red wavelengths to the left. The basic
operation of {\sc gaia} is all ``point and
click'' and is fairly intuitive (online help is available by
clicking on the {\sc help} tab in the top right corner of the {\sc
gaia} window). You should spend some time familiarizing yourself with
how {\sc gaia} operates, learning how to zoom in and out, change the
display levels etc. If you are having difficulties, ask your lab
demonstrator to show you how the basic features work.

At this stage it is necessary to convert the two-dimensional Helium
image into a one dimensional spectrum. First, workout how many pixels
wide your two-dimensional Helium spectrum is (should be 1280 pixels). Next, workout what
the middle y-pixel value of the Helium spectrum is. As an example, if
the middle y-pixel value is 480 (and the spectrum is 1280 pixels wide) you would then type:

{\tt imcopy heliumspectrum.fits[1:1280,480:480] helium\verb,_,trim.fits}

which will produce a new, one dimensional spectrum running from x=1
to x=1280, but only one pixel wide. This is a spectrum of flux versus
x-pixel value which is suitable for further analysis. You can take a
first look at your one-dimensional spectrum using the {\sc iraf} task 
{\it splot} (spectra-plot). At the command prompt type:

{\tt splot helium\verb,_trim,.fits}

If {\it splot} asks you for a dispersion direction, type {\tt 1
  <return>}. As well as simply displaying spectra, the {\it splot} task allows you
to perform many basic analysis tasks (ask the demonstrator to show you
how it works).


The next stage in the process is to perform the wavelength
calibration. At present, the one-dimensional Helium spectrum is 
simply flux versus x-pixel number, and we need to convert this into a 
one-dimensional spectrum of flux versus wavelength. The wavelength
calibration is performed using the {\sc iraf} task {\it identify}. 
At the command prompt, type:

{\tt identify helium\verb,_trim,.fits}

Which should open a new window displaying the one-dimensional Helium
spectrum. In order to make the identification of the arc lines easier, it
may be worthwhile extending the new window horizontally (ask the
demonstrator how to do this).



To identify the lines, click on the {\it identify} window to activate
it, place the cursor over the arc line of interest and press the ``m''
key to mark the line. At this point you will be asked to enter the
wavelength of the arc line. Repeat this process
until you have identified the $\simeq 9$ Helium lines which should be
visible in your spectrum. 

\noindent
Once you have
identified the lines you can press ``f'' to fit the dispersion
solution. The {\it identify} window will update to show you the fit,
at which point you can delete outlier points with the ``d'' key and
re-fit the solution by pressing ``f'' once again. {\bf Once you are happy
with the quality of the fit (all points within $\simeq1$\AA\,) you
should first note down the r.m.s of your wavelength solution (displayed in
{\tt xterm window}) because this is the typical uncertainty in the 
transformation between pixel coordinates and wavelength, which you will require later.}
Next you should press ``q'' twice to exit {\it identify}, and then
confirm (in the {\tt iraf} window) that you want to write the dispersion solution to the database. 

To let {\sc iraf} know that you want to associate this dispersion
solution with your one-dimensional spectrum, type:

{\tt hedit helium\verb,_trim,.fits fields=REFSPEC1 value=helium\verb,_trim,.fits}

And finally, to apply the wavelength calibration to your spectrum, type:

{\tt dispcor helium\verb,_trim.fits helium_trim_wave.fits,}

You can now check that your wavelength solution is sensible by
displaying your wavelength calibrated Helium spectrum using {\tt splot}:

{\tt splot \verb,helium_trim_wave.fits,}

and by measuring the wavelengths of the emission lines using the
cursor and by pressing the space bar.

\newpage


\bigskip
{\bf 3c. Identifying the unknown elements}

\noindent
To do this you should first process each of your different spectral images into
one-dimesional spectra as outlined above. Following that you can apply
your wavelength calibration using {\tt hedit} and {\tt dispcor}, again
as outlined above. Once you have produced wavelength calibrated
spectra for each element, you can measure the wavelengths of any
emission lines and compare them with standard laboratory values\footnote{

{\tt http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/ASD/lines\_form.html}}. 

Note that you need to estimate the errors in your result to assess the wavelength matches
that you find. You can present the results in your laboratory report
in either a tabular or graphical format (see GnuPlot tutorial in
Appendix 3 for information on producing simple graphs).


{\bf 4. CALIBRATING A SET OF COLOUR FILTERS}

The aim is to produce a graph of transmission versus wavelength 
for a set of three colour filters. This is a task that is routinely
done by astronomers when they set up new colour photometric systems,
or design filters to image just one spectral emission line, or design
blocking filters for spectrometers on telescopes.

1. It is easiest to start with the green filter. Set up the continuum
light source (bulb), and insert the filter in front of the slit. Seek
a position and exposure/intensity setting that shows (a) no saturation
of the CCD for filtered or unfiltered light, (b) full wavelength
coverage of the part of the spectrum transmitted by the filter\footnote{
You can check if the image is saturating by clicking on the {\tt
  ``horizontal line cut''} icon and examining the count levels in the image rows}.

   {\it If you have moved the grating or camera since doing the previous
   experiment, you need to take another Helium image for
   wavelength calibration purposes. If you haven't changed the
   spectrograph set-up, then your previous wavelength calibration
   should still be valid.}

2. Without altering any other part of the set-up,  make and save {\sl
   unsaturated} images of the continuum source with and without the
   green filter (use the same exposure time for each).

3. Also without altering any of the settings, make and save a `dark' frame by
   covering the camera lens with the lens cap before taking another
   exposure of the same duration. The dark frame is a measurement of the
   instrument noise produced in the absence of any signal.

4. After transfering your images to blackford, you should first
   subtract the dark frame from the filtered and unfiltered images using
   the {\tt imarith} task in {\sc iraf}:

   For example: {\tt \verb,imarith cont_spectrum.fits - dark_spectrum.fits cont_dark.fits,}

5. After dark subtraction you should produce one-dimensional,
   wavelength calibrated, spectra of the filtered and unfiltered images
   following the procedure from the previous experiment.

\newpage

6. Finally, by dividing the two spectra (i.e. filtered/unfiltered
   using {\sc imarith}) you can produce a curve of
   the filter transmission with wavelength. You should be able to
   display this transmission curve using {\sc splot} and include the
   plot in your final report (see page 11).

   {\bf Remember that if the signal-to-noise you obtain for the transmission curve is too low, it is possible
to take several images and add them up to improve the final signal-to-noise.}

7. Once you have successfully produced the transmission curve for the
   green filter, the final task is to produce identical curves for the
   orange/yellow and blue filters. The transmission curves for all
   three filters should be included in your final report. In the
   report you should comment on the different sources of uncertainty in your
   derivation of the filter curves, and how these could in principle
   be reduced.

   {\it For the yellow and blue filters you may need to
   adjust the exposure times to obtain images of the
   filtered spectrum with sufficient signal to analyse. In which case 
   you will need to remember to take separate dark frames of the
   appropriate exposure time. Moreover, when you divide the filtered
   by the unfiltered spectrum to produce the transmission curve, you
   must first correct for any difference in exposure time (using {\tt imarith})}.

\leftline{\Large Useful software packages}

For working with ascii data files on the Unix system it is probably
easiest to use the basic text editor package: {\it emacs}. To open a new
file with emacs, simply type at the command prompt:

{\tt emacs myfile.txt (return)}

For grabbing screenshots and converting images between different
formats, a useful software package on the Unix system is {\it xv}. To
launch xv just type at the command prompt:

{\tt xv (return)}

For viewing and printing postscript files, use the software package
{\it gv}. At the command prompt type:

{\tt gv (return)}

For plotting graphs and fitting functions the easiest package to use
if probably {\it gnuplot}. On the next page there is a brief tutorial
on how do use gnuplot.


\newpage
\centerline{\Huge APPENDIX 3}

\begin{center}
{\large{\bf Gnuplot}}
\end{center}
This is designed to be a very brief tutorial on using the plotting
package Gnuplot. More information can be found at: {\tt
http://www.gnuplot.info/}, and a more detailed tutorial can be found
at: {\tt http://www.duke.edu/~hpgavin/gnuplot.html}.

Start Gnuplot by simply typing:

{\tt gnuplot -mono (return)}

on the command line. In your home directory I have included a file
called {\tt toydata.dat} to illustrate how the basic features of
Gnuplot work. This file contains three columns: x, y \& y error. 
To simply plot x versus y, type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot ``toydata.dat''}

Gnuplot should produce a plot of x versus y in a new window, and will
automatically choose appropriate ranges for the x-axis and y-axis. To
label the axes and to add a title type:

{\tt gnuplot> set xlabel ``x''}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set ylabel ``y''}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set title ``toydata plot''}

If you now type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot ``toydata.dat''}

The graph should be correctly labelled. To plot the data including the
errors on the y variable you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot ``toydata.dat'' with yerrorbars}

To fit a function to your data-set you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> f1(x)=a*x+b}

which defines a new linear function (gnuplot can fit much more
complicated functions if necessary). And then type:

{\tt gnuplot> fit f1(x) ``toydata.dat'' using 1:2 via a,b}

which tells Gnuplot to fit the function to columns 1 \& 2 of
``toydata.dat'', determining the best-fitting values of parameters a
\& b. To then produce a combined plot of your data and the best-fitting
function you can type:

{\tt gnuplot> plot ``toydata.dat'' with yerrorbars, f1(x)}\\
\newpage
At the end of this process the graph in the Gnuplot window should look
something like Fig 1. If you wanted to save your graph as a postscript
file (suitable for printing) you could type:

{\tt gnuplot> set terminal postscript landscape}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set output ``toydataplot.ps''}\\
{\tt gnuplot> plot ``toydata.dat'' with yerrorbars, f1(x)}\\
{\tt gnuplot> set terminal x11}

which should produce a postscript file called ``toydataplot.ps''. The
final command returns the default output to the normal Gnuplot
window. To exit Gnuplot type {\tt CNTR-D}.
